 <h3> About me 👨‍💻 </h3>


- 🎓 &nbsp; I recently graduated from the Univeristy of Bristol with a master's in Engineering Mathematics achieving a grade of 2:1. 
- ⚙️ &nbsp; Engineering Mathematic offers a mixture of general engineering, mathematics, computer science and data science.
- 🛠 &nbsp; Throughout my academic career, I have developed a wide range of skills due to the versatility of my course, and  have applied such skills to formulate mathematical and computational solutions to real-life problems.
- 💻 &nbsp; My passion for coding flourished as I faced complex challenges that required intricate and innovative solutions. I thrived in this environment, relishing the opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills.
- ✍ &nbsp; I am currently enrolled into CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course by Harvard University as I recognised the importance of mastering the fundamental concepts and building blocks of computer science. This versatile course teaches C, Python, HTML, SQL, CSS, JavaScript and Flask and I will be documenting my progress with you guys!
- 👨🏽‍🎓 &nbsp; This portfolio showcases the projects I have undertook in my academic career as well as my personal time.
